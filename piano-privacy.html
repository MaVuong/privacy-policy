    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: October 7, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <span style="font-weight: bold;">TinyKitten Studio</span> ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information in connection with your use of the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Real Piano</span>" iOS application (the "App").</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We use third-party services, primarily for providing and maintaining the App, analyzing usage, and displaying advertisements. These services automatically collect certain information when you use our App. We do not directly collect personal information such as your name or email address.</p>
    
    <h3>Data Collected by Third-Party Partners (Advertising and Analytics)</h3>
    <p>The following categories of data are collected via third-party SDKs, including **Google Mobile Ads (AdMob)**, **Firebase**, and our mediation partners (**Pangle, AppLovin, and ironSource**):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Identifiers:</strong> Device ID (such as the Advertising Identifier - IDFA, where permitted by user consent via the App Tracking Transparency framework) and other device-level identifiers.</li>
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> Coarse Location (location data inferred from IP address).</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Product Interaction (e.g., app launch, taps, video views) and Advertising Data (e.g., ads viewed).</li>
        <li><strong>Diagnostics:</strong> Crash Data and Performance Data (e.g., app launch time, hang rate, energy usage).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The collected data is used for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Advertising:</strong> To serve personalized and targeted advertisements through our partners (AdMob, Pangle, AppLovin, ironSource) and to measure the effectiveness of those ads. This process involves **tracking** your activity across apps and websites owned by other companies.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> To understand how users interact with the App, track overall usage trends, and analyze the effectiveness of product features using services like **Firebase Analytics**.</li>
        <li><strong>App Functionality and Maintenance:</strong> To diagnose and fix technical issues, monitor app performance, and ensure the stability of the App using data like Crash Data and Performance Data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Partners</h2>
    <p>We utilize a mediation platform to manage various ad networks. Your data is shared with these third-party partners for advertising, analytics, and fraud prevention purposes. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of our key partners:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google AdMob Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy?hl=en" target="_blank">Firebase Analytics</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy?hl=en" target="_blank">Firebase Crashlytics</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.pangleglobal.com/privacy/enduser-en" target="_blank">Pangle Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.applovin.com/privacy/" target="_blank">AppLovin Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.is.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">ironSource Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. App Tracking Transparency (ATT)</h2>
    <p>Since we use your data for "tracking" (serving personalized ads), we are required to comply with Apple's App Tracking Transparency framework. We will ask for your permission before using your device's Advertising Identifier (IDFA) for tracking purposes. If you deny this permission, you will still see ads, but they will not be personalized.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights regarding your personal data, such as the right to access, delete, or restrict the processing of your data. Since most of the data is collected by third parties and is non-identifiable to us, please refer to the respective third-party privacy policies for exercising these rights.</p>
